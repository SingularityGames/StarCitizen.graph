To back up and restore your Star Citizen installation, including keybinds and settings, follow these steps:
1. Backing up your Star Citizen installation:
Locate your Star Citizen install folder: By default, this is located at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen.
Copy the entire Star Citizen folder: Copy the entire StarCitizen folder to a backup location, like an external drive or a different partition. 
2. Backing up Keybindings and Control Profiles:
Export your keybindings:
In-game, press Esc to open the options menu.
Go to Options > Keybindings.
Select your device (e.g., Joystick, HOTAS).
Click Advanced Controls Customization.
Click Control Profiles > Save Control Settings.
Give your profile a descriptive name and save.
Locate your Keybindings and Profile files:
Navigate to your Star Citizen install folder, then go to LIVE\USER\Client\0\Controls\Mappings.
You'll find your saved keybinding files (likely XML files).
Your profile settings are located in LIVE\USER\Client\0\Profiles.
Copy Keybinding and Profile files: Copy these files to your backup location along with the Star Citizen game folder. 
3. Restoring your Star Citizen Installation, Keybindings, and Settings:
Reinstall Star Citizen Launcher: Download and install the Star Citizen launcher if you've reinstalled Windows or are setting up a new PC.
Stop the initial download: Once the launcher starts downloading the game, pause or exit the launcher.
Copy your backed up files:
Copy the entire StarCitizen folder from your backup location into the appropriate location.
If restoring on the same drive, overwrite the newly created Star Citizen folder.
Restore Keybindings and Profile files:
Copy your backed-up keybinding files into the LIVE\USER\Client\0\Controls\Mappings folder.
Copy your backed-up profile folder into the LIVE\USER\Client\0\Profiles folder.
Verify the game files:
Open the Star Citizen launcher.
Go to settings and ensure the game installation path matches where you copied the backed-up folder.
Click the Verify button in the launcher.
Load your Keybindings:
Launch Star Citizen and go to Options > Keybindings.
Select your device.
Click Advanced Controls Customization.
Click Control Profiles > Load Control Settings.
Choose your saved profile and click Load. 
Important Considerations:
User Folder: CIG (Cloud Imperium Games) recommends deleting or backing up and restoring the USER folder when applying new patches, as old settings can sometimes cause issues.
Large Install Size: Be aware that Star Citizen has a significant install size, so ensure your backup drive has sufficient space.
Verify Backups: Regularly verify your backups to ensure their integrity. 
By following these steps, you should be able to restore your Star Citizen installation, along with your custom keybindings and game settings, saving you time and effort.
